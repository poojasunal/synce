## Why Synce
Even though we have devices with different platforms but they still seems disconnected as they are not synced. Recently I tried to share File from android to windows but found no Easy way to share files, the same goes for any other type of syncing like accessing storage of different device or accepting call from a desktop device. Here comes Synce which can help you with that, although this is still a WIP but below you can checkout some Planned features and tech stack chosen for now.

## Planned Features
- Share Files to any device, any platform
- Sync Clipboard across all devices
- Share Keyboard, Mouse or even touch of one device to another
- Sync Media Player across devices
- Accept call from any device
- Sync Storage of across devices
- Share or Extend screens across devices

## Planned Tech Stack
- Frontend - Flutter
- Backend  - Rust and Dart
